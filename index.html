        <h2>InCySe Objectives</h2>
        <p>The idea behind InCySe is two-fold. First, it is to encourage students, especially from underrepresented groups, to consider a career in industrial cybersecurity. Second, it is to impart basic working knowledge of emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI through hands-on learning facilitated by the hackathon challenges. InCySe would target high school seniors, freshman, and sophomore undergraduate students with a special emphasis on underrepresented groups with active participation from our Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) and NSF-funded programs at Oklahoma State such as OKLSAMP.</p>

    <section id="executive-plan">
        <h2>Executive Plan</h2>
        <p>The PI plans to organize three InCySe events (one for each year of the project timeline) with potential support from this project. Each InCySe event is planned to be a two-day event. On Day 1, the PI and his graduate students will organize a bootcamp/workshop to provide participants with an overview of the hackathon problem themes, rules, and regulations. This would also include mini-tutorials regarding basic AI algorithms, blockchains, SmartContracts, IPFS, as well as other platforms and tools that can be useful to tackle the hackathon challenges.</p>
        <p><strong>Gustavo</strong> would be a vital tool for the participants to build and test their solutions in a distributed way with a minimal learning curve. Hackathon challenges would comprise predefined problem statements with accompanying datasets. Participants must uniquely leverage relevant tools and platforms from the bootcamp to solve. There will also be an open-ended challenge in which participants are free to identify a problem of their own and develop a relevant solution framework within the ambit of industrial cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>On Day 2, the hackathon commences, and challenges would be publicly revealed. Participants have 24 hours to submit their solutions online. Group participation would be welcome and encouraged. All InCySe events would be hybrid events, and remote participation would be welcome. Coordination of the entire InCySe event would be done on Discord, including live streaming. Judging of the event and announcement of the winners would be done at the end of Day 2, with the help of a panel of judges including the PI along with active participation from industry experts.</p>
